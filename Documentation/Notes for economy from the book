 For example,
if X is the only good, and L, labor, is the only factor, the utility of person h
might be represented as:
U h Uh(Xh; 24-Lh)


Utility functions are always assumed to be continuous, strictly quasi-concave, and twice
differentiable, with all goods and factors infinitely divisible. 

THE PARETO-OPTIMAL CONDITIONS : existence of an allocation of resources such that no one consumer can be
made better off by a reallocation of resources without simultaneously making
at least one other consumer worse off. 

#Which I would say only means that all existing products have to be consumed. 

This interpretation indicates that the set of pareto-optimal allocations
for all H individuals can be determined by solving the following problem
algebraically: Hold everyone's utility constant except for one person, arbitrarily chosen to be person 1. Maximize person l's utility subject to the constraints that all other utilities are held constant. Include as additional
constraints the G production technologies and the G + F market clearance
requirements. 

max
(Xhg; Vhf; xg; rgf)
s.t.
u ~ (xlg; vie)
~h wh(Xhg; Vhf) h 2, ..., H
X g qb g (rgr) g 1, ..., G
H
Xhg X g g 1, ..., G
h 1
H G
Vhf ~ rgf f 1, ..., F 

But the constraints imposed upon utility levels of persons h 2,..., H, the W h, are
entirely arbitrary. Placing at least one of these consumers at a different utility
level and solving the model again generates a different allocation of resources,
so long as the new constraints permit a feasible solution (U 1 () _> 0). Since the
utility constraints can be reset in infinitely many ways, solutions to the
constrained optimum problem generate an infinity of feasible solutions in 
40 EQUITY: THE SOCIALWELFARE FUNCTION AND OPTIMAL DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
general, all points on the utility-possibilities frontier.
